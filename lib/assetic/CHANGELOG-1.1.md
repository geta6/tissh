1.1.0 (???)
---------------------

 * Added the UglifyJsFilter
 * added support for asset variables: 
 
       Asset variables allow you to pre-compile your assets for a finite set of known
       variable values, and then to simply deliver the correct asset version at runtime.
       For example, this is helpful for assets with language, or browser-specific code.
